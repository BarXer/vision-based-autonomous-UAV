# Autonomous Drone
[Robot Operating System] (http://wiki.ros.org/) (ROS) framework for autonomous landing of a UAV on the target using onboard control. GPS based navigation systems are unsuitable for precision task such as landing therefore computer vision techniques have been used to detect the target accurately and estimate the distance. 

The drone used is [DJI-Matrice] (http://www.dji.com/matrice100). NVIDIA [Jetson-TK1] (http://elinux.org/Jetson_TK1) is used for the onboard control along with a usb camera.
